# Netflix Sync Party
Chrome extension to easily let you sync the start times of Netflix shows with your friends.

No ads, no login.
Free and source.

Made with ❤️ by Deb

Doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll almost always have a chat that you use to plan your party anyway.

## Installation

### Install the developer version directly from GitHub

This is useful if you want to mess with the code and add/remove features

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/debkbanerji/netflix-sync-extension/releases)
2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`
    * The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, selecting **Settings** then selecting **Extensions**.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
4. Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the `extension` directory within the release you downloaded.
