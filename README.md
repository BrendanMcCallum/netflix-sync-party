2. Open the Extension Management page within Chrome by navigating to `chrome://extensions`
    * The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, selecting **Settings** then selecting **Extensions**.

## FAQ

### Do you support chat?

The extension doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll almost always have a chat that you use to plan your party anyway.

### Why did you make this?

I made this for my friends, since other solutions were kind of unreliable when we tried them, and they wanted something simple and stable that could sync our movies during a call.
