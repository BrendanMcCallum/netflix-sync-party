# Netflix Sync Party
Chrome extension to easily let you sync the start times of Netflix shows with your friends.

Free, open source, lightweight, no login, no nonsense.

Made with ❤️

Fully client side so it won't be affected by load on other servers.

Doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll almost certainly have a chat that you use to plan your party anyway.

## Installation

### Install the developer version directly from GitHub

This is useful if you want to mess with the code and add/remove features

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`
⋅⋅* The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, selecting **Settings** then selecting **Extensions**.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
3. Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the `extension` directory.
