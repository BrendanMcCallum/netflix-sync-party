# Easy Netflix Time Sync
Chrome extension to easily let you sync the start times of Netflix shows with your friends.

Fully client side so it won't be affected by load on other servers. Lightweight and open source with no login required.

Doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll almost certainly have a chat that you use to plan this stuff and share the link anyway. (also this is what allows it to be serverless :p)

(Currently under construction - I hope this actually works lol)
